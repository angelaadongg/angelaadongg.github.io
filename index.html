                                        <p class="review-text">"Angela is incredibly meticulous and naturally curious, with a sharp ability to understand complex processes quickly and deeply. Something I particularly highlight in her work is how thoughtful she is: she doesn't just accept things as they are. She questions, challenges, and explores different angles to make sure we're choosing the best strategy and doing the right thing — for the product, for the team, and for the users.

On top of that, Angela's communication skills are impressive. She brings clarity, structure, and calm to conversations, and she has the humility and self-awareness to raise her hand when something isn't clear. She's never afraid to ask for help, request mentorship, or seek out the knowledge she needs — and that mindset is exactly what makes her grow so quickly.

Angela is also an excellent team player. She is always willing to support others, but she does so with a healthy understanding of boundaries and limitations — which is a strength not everyone has. She collaborates with empathy, maturity, and reliability.

It has been a pleasure to watch her grow into the Product Manager role, and I have no doubt she will continue to thrive wherever she goes next. Any team would be lucky to have her."</p>

She's a true enabler, someone who makes things happen, and makes them happen the right way. Angela has a great sense of structure and clarity, and her communication skills are exceptional. She understands the core of an issue quickly and adapts her message depending on who she's speaking to, ensuring everyone has the context they need to move with confidence.

She brings calm, focus, and momentum to every team she's part of. I'd work with her again in a heartbeat :) "</p>

She's brilliant at keeping the team focused on UX, preventing us from taking the 'easy' technical route at the expense of the person using the tool. She's also a total lifesaver in the trenches. She recently helped me navigate a massive hurdle with niche data sources that I was struggling to pin down. Her resilience is easily her top talent."</p>
